### Hey! This is a prototype of an app for interier design studio. 
#### Right now I see 2 stages of development

## Stage 1 - Basis
- [x] Basic pages with UI
- [x] Local SQL database
- [ ] Few access levels (User, moderator, admin)
- [ ] Creating/updating/deleting an order
- [ ] Settings page for updating your user info
- [ ] File manager controller (to be able to upload file to an order)

## Stage 2 - REST API + Authentification
- [ ] From local to online database
- [ ] Online authentification via phone/mail + using token in authorization
